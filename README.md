Black hole simulator created for ASTRO 101 Creative Work assignment. This repo is mostly self contained and is basically a pruned ![openFrameworks repo](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks).

## Old Version:
I tried expirimenting with 3D, but switched to 2D afterwards. I also decided to focus more on visualization than simulation.
